## summon-meme is a fun cli app which shows you a new meme from reddit and much more...

## There are two main commands

1. get-meme: will open a ramdom meme for you.
2. help: will show how to use it.

## User can customize the output by passing multiple arguments eg: subreddit name, number of memes you want to fetch

User have to specify the type of argument using flags.
eg: get-meme cat --subreddit here cat is the name of subreddit
eg: get-meme cat 4 --subreddit --count Here 4 is number of image you want to fetch

## Other important flags are

1. --save: to save a meme to local machine
2. --visit: to open the meme post on reddit
3. --json: to print the result to console
